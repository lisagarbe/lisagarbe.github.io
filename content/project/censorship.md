This project examines the causes and consequences of online censorship. Governments worldwide frequently block and censor internet access often during times of political contention. First, I study the role that telecommunications companies play in facilitating or hindering internet censorship using data from the [Telecommunications Ownership and Control (TOSCO) Dataset](https://tosco.shinyapps.io/data/), a large-scale data collection effort in collaboration with researchers at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/) and the [University of Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?locale=de). 

Second, I study the consequences of online censorship for offline protest using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) data to infer moments of censorship in collaboration with researchers at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/), the [University of Oxford](https://www.unisg.ch/en/) and [Stockholm University](https://www.unisg.ch/en/). A previous publication examined the consequences of an internet shutdown for electoral violence during the Ugandan 2016 presidential elections.
