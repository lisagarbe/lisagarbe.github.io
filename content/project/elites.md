This research project explores how elite networks shape politics and affect political inequality. First, joint work with researchers at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/) and the [University of Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?locale=de) examines the networks between foreign-authoritarian shareholders of internet-providing companies and their role in tightening control over local internet provision using data from the TOSCO project (link to TOSCO project). 

More recent work together with researchers at [WZB](https://wzb.eu/de) explores the role that networks between political and economic elites play in shaping political inequality. We currently pilot a data collection based on publicly available Wiki data entries and social media data to assess the scope for a global data set of elites. We further analyse the effect of connections between Members of Parliament and economic elites on housing markets in the German context.
