In the Global South, governments increasingly use Artificial Intelligence often in an attempt to make government structures more efficient and facilitate citizens' access to state services. In this research project, I look at two applications of AI in Global South countries. 

First, I examine how different aspects of biometric identification systems affect different groups in society. In this project, together with researchers at the [WZB](https://wzb.eu/de), [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), and [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), we run a survey experiment to analyze the effect of different policies governing biometric identification on citizens' willingness to register for such a program across different ethnic groups in Kenya. You can find the pre-analysis plan for this project [here](https://osf.io/57gqx). 

Second, together with researchers at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) and [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) we explore different applications of Facial Recognition Technologies (FRT) in sub-Saharan Africa and their impact on assembly in public spaces.
