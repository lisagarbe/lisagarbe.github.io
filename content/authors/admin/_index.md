I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Institutions and Political Inequality unit at the [Berlin Social Science Center (WZB)](https://wzb.eu/de) in Berlin, Germany. I graduated with a PhD in Political Science from the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/), Switzerland, in 2021. I study authoritarianism and political exclusion with a particular focus on how digitalization affects core democratic processes such as elections. My current research explores how governments censor internet access and the consequences of censorship for political mobilization in Africa. I have conducted research in Uganda and Ethiopia. 


See my [CV](files/cv_meder.pdf) for details.
